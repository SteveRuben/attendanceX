## 🎯 Test Scenarios

### OAuth Flow Testing
```typescript
describe('OAuth Integration Flow', () => {
  test('Google OAuth complete flow', async () => {
    // Test complete OAuth flow from initiation to token storage
  });
  
  test('Microsoft OAuth with custom scopes', async () => {
    // Test OAuth with specific permission scopes
  });
  
  test('OAuth error handling', async () => {
    // Test error scenarios and user feedback
  });
});
```

### Sync Testing
```typescript
describe('Data Synchronization', () => {
  test('Calendar sync accuracy', async () => {
    // Verify calendar events sync correctly
  });
  
  test('Bidirectional sync conflicts', async () => {
    // Test conflict resolution in bidirectional sync
  });
  
  test('Large dataset sync performance', async () => {
    // Test sync with 10,000+ calendar events
  });
});
```
