# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The backend presence management system currently has 118 TypeScript compilation errors across 25 files. These errors are preventing successful builds and are specifically related to the presence management functionality. The errors fall into several categories:

1. Missing middleware files and dependencies
2. Type mismatches in presence-related interfaces
3. Missing properties on Request objects (user context)
4. Incorrect Firebase/Firestore integration
5. Missing external dependencies (express-rate-limit, pdfkit)
6. Interface mismatches between shared types and implementation
7. Deprecated crypto methods usage
8. Missing service methods and incorrect method signatures

This spec addresses the systematic resolution of these presence-specific compilation errors to ensure the presence management system builds successfully.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Fix Missing Middleware and Dependencies

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all required middleware files and dependencies to be available so that the presence system can import and use them without compilation errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN importing presence middleware THEN the middleware files SHALL exist and export the required functions
2. WHEN using express-rate-limit THEN it SHALL be properly installed and imported
3. WHEN importing presence-validation middleware THEN it SHALL exist and provide the required validation functions
4. WHEN using external dependencies THEN they SHALL be properly installed with their type definitions

### Requirement 2: Fix Request Object Type Extensions

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Request object to include user context properties so that authentication middleware can provide user information to route handlers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing req.user THEN it SHALL include uid, email, role, permissions, and sessionId properties
2. WHEN checking user permissions THEN the user object SHALL include isAdmin property or equivalent role checking
3. WHEN working with authenticated requests THEN the user context SHALL be properly typed
4. WHEN accessing user organization context THEN the user object SHALL include organization-related properties

### Requirement 3: Fix Presence Interface Type Mismatches

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all presence-related interfaces to match their actual usage so that the code compiles without type errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using ReportFilters THEN organizationId SHALL be properly typed as required or optional based on usage
2. WHEN working with PresenceEntry THEN it SHALL include all computed properties like totalHours, effectiveHours, totalBreakHours
3. WHEN using PresenceAlert THEN it SHALL include all required properties like types, details, entryId
4. WHEN working with ScheduledReport THEN the filters property SHALL match ReportFilters interface
5. WHEN using GeoLocation THEN latitude and longitude SHALL be properly typed as required

### Requirement 4: Fix Firebase/Firestore Integration Issues

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Firebase/Firestore integration to work correctly so that database operations compile without errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN importing firestore THEN it SHALL be properly imported from the correct Firebase module
2. WHEN using collections THEN they SHALL exist in the collections configuration
3. WHEN working with Firestore documents THEN the operations SHALL match the expected API
4. WHEN using FieldValue THEN it SHALL be properly imported and used

### Requirement 5: Fix Service Method Signatures

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all service method calls to match their actual implementations so that the application functions correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calling notification service methods THEN they SHALL exist on the service class
2. WHEN calling presence service methods THEN they SHALL accept the correct parameter types
3. WHEN using scheduled functions THEN they SHALL match the Firebase Functions API
4. WHEN calling audit and compliance methods THEN they SHALL be implemented in their respective services

### Requirement 6: Fix External Dependencies and Deprecated APIs

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use current, non-deprecated APIs and have all required dependencies available so that the code is maintainable and secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using crypto operations THEN they SHALL use current, non-deprecated methods
2. WHEN generating PDFs THEN PDFDocument SHALL be properly imported and instantiated
3. WHEN using rate limiting THEN express-rate-limit SHALL be properly installed and configured
4. WHEN working with scheduled functions THEN they SHALL return void or Promise<void> as expected

### Requirement 7: Fix Model Property Access

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to access all necessary properties on models so that business logic can be implemented correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN working with Employee models THEN computed properties like workingYears SHALL be properly typed
2. WHEN working with LeaveRequest models THEN duration and balanceImpact SHALL be properly typed
3. WHEN working with WorkSchedule models THEN workingDays and weeklyPattern SHALL be accessible
4. WHEN working with PresenceEntry models THEN duration and computed fields SHALL be properly typed

### Requirement 8: Fix Unused Code and Imports

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the codebase to be clean without unused imports and variables so that the build process is efficient and the code is maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN imports are declared THEN they SHALL be used in the file or removed
2. WHEN variables are declared THEN they SHALL be used or removed
3. WHEN destructuring assignments are made THEN all destructured elements SHALL be used or marked as intentionally unused
4. WHEN parameters are declared THEN they SHALL be used or prefixed with underscore if intentionally unused

### Requirement 9: Ensure Backward Compatibility

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the type fixes to maintain backward compatibility so that existing presence management functionality continues to work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN fixing types THEN existing API contracts SHALL remain unchanged
2. WHEN updating interfaces THEN optional properties SHALL be used where appropriate to maintain compatibility
3. WHEN modifying shared types THEN all consuming code SHALL continue to function
4. WHEN resolving errors THEN the fixes SHALL not break existing presence management business logic
