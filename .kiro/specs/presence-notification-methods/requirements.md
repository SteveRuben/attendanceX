# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The presence management system's triggers are calling several notification methods on the `PresenceNotificationService` that don't exist, causing TypeScript compilation errors. These missing methods are essential for providing comprehensive notifications about presence-related events such as leave approvals/rejections, clock-out confirmations, validation notifications, anomaly alerts, and welcome messages for new employees.

The current `PresenceNotificationService` has basic notification functionality but is missing several key methods that are being called from the presence triggers, preventing the system from compiling and functioning properly.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Leave Request Notification Methods

**User Story:** As an employee, I want to receive notifications when my leave requests are approved or rejected so that I can plan accordingly and understand the status of my requests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a leave request is approved THEN the system SHALL send a notification to the employee with approval details
2. WHEN a leave request is rejected THEN the system SHALL send a notification to the employee with rejection reason
3. WHEN sending leave approval notifications THEN they SHALL include leave dates, type, and any special instructions
4. WHEN sending leave rejection notifications THEN they SHALL include the rejection reason and next steps
5. WHEN leave notifications are sent THEN they SHALL be logged for audit purposes

### Requirement 2: Clock-Out and Validation Notifications

**User Story:** As an employee, I want to receive confirmations when I clock out and when my presence entries are validated so that I have confidence in the accuracy of my time tracking.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an employee clocks out THEN the system SHALL send a confirmation notification with work hours summary
2. WHEN a presence entry is validated by a manager THEN the employee SHALL receive a validation notification
3. WHEN sending clock-out confirmations THEN they SHALL include total hours worked and any overtime
4. WHEN sending validation notifications THEN they SHALL indicate who validated the entry and when
5. WHEN clock-out reminders are needed THEN the system SHALL send missed clock-out reminders

### Requirement 3: Anomaly Detection Notifications

**User Story:** As a manager and employee, I want to be notified when presence anomalies are detected so that issues can be addressed promptly and accurately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN presence anomalies are detected THEN the system SHALL send alerts to relevant parties
2. WHEN anomaly severity is high THEN notifications SHALL be sent immediately with high priority
3. WHEN sending anomaly alerts THEN they SHALL include anomaly type, details, and suggested actions
4. WHEN anomalies affect multiple employees THEN managers SHALL receive consolidated alerts
5. WHEN anomaly alerts are sent THEN they SHALL include links to review and resolve the issues

### Requirement 4: Employee Welcome Notifications

**User Story:** As a new employee, I want to receive welcome notifications with presence system information so that I understand how to use the time tracking system effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new employee is created THEN they SHALL receive a welcome notification with presence system overview
2. WHEN sending welcome notifications THEN they SHALL include instructions for clocking in/out
3. WHEN welcome notifications are sent THEN they SHALL include work schedule information
4. WHEN new employees receive welcome messages THEN they SHALL include contact information for support
5. WHEN welcome notifications are sent THEN they SHALL be personalized with employee name and role

### Requirement 5: Enhanced Missed Clock-Out Reminders

**User Story:** As an employee, I want to receive timely reminders when I forget to clock out so that my time tracking remains accurate and complete.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an employee forgets to clock out THEN they SHALL receive reminder notifications
2. WHEN missed clock-out reminders are sent THEN they SHALL include the clock-in time and current duration
3. WHEN reminders are sent multiple times THEN the frequency SHALL be appropriate and not overwhelming
4. WHEN employees consistently miss clock-outs THEN managers SHALL be notified of the pattern
5. WHEN clock-out reminders are sent THEN they SHALL include easy links to complete the clock-out

### Requirement 6: Notification Method Consistency

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all notification methods to follow consistent patterns and interfaces so that the system is maintainable and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing notification methods THEN they SHALL follow the same error handling patterns as existing methods
2. WHEN notification methods are called THEN they SHALL accept consistent parameter types
3. WHEN notifications are sent THEN they SHALL use the same underlying notification infrastructure
4. WHEN notification methods fail THEN they SHALL log errors appropriately without breaking the calling code
5. WHEN notification templates are used THEN they SHALL be consistent with existing notification formatting

### Requirement 7: Integration with Existing Notification System

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the new notification methods to integrate seamlessly with the existing notification infrastructure so that all notifications are handled consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new notification methods are implemented THEN they SHALL use the existing notification templates system
2. WHEN notifications are sent THEN they SHALL respect user notification preferences
3. WHEN notification methods are called THEN they SHALL use the existing recipient resolution logic
4. WHEN notifications are queued THEN they SHALL use the existing notification scheduling system
5. WHEN notification delivery fails THEN they SHALL use the existing retry mechanisms

### Requirement 8: Backward Compatibility and Error Handling

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the new notification methods to handle errors gracefully so that presence system functionality continues even if notifications fail.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN notification methods encounter errors THEN they SHALL not break the calling trigger functions
2. WHEN notification services are unavailable THEN the methods SHALL fail gracefully with appropriate logging
3. WHEN implementing new methods THEN they SHALL maintain compatibility with existing notification interfaces
4. WHEN notification methods are called with invalid data THEN they SHALL validate inputs and handle errors appropriately
5. WHEN notification delivery fails THEN the system SHALL continue processing other presence operations
