# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The backend application currently has 234 TypeScript compilation errors across 35 files. These errors are preventing successful builds and indicate type safety issues that could lead to runtime errors. The errors fall into several categories:

1. Missing ValidationError class definition
2. Express.js middleware type mismatches (Request/Response types)
3. Missing enum imports (AttendanceStatus, AttendanceMethod)
4. Unused variable declarations
5. Missing properties on Request objects (get, protocol, originalUrl, etc.)
6. Router middleware type compatibility issues
7. Missing service methods and incorrect method signatures

This spec addresses the systematic resolution of these compilation errors to ensure type safety and successful builds.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Create Missing Error Classes

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error classes to be available so that I can throw typed errors in my application code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ValidationError is used THEN it SHALL be properly defined and importable
2. WHEN throwing validation errors THEN they SHALL follow a consistent constructor signature
3. WHEN error classes are defined THEN they SHALL extend the base Error class
4. WHEN custom errors are used THEN they SHALL provide meaningful error messages and context

### Requirement 2: Fix Express.js Type Compatibility

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Express.js middleware and route handlers to have compatible types so that the application compiles without type errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using authenticate middleware THEN it SHALL be compatible with Express Router.use() method
2. WHEN using requirePermission middleware THEN it SHALL match Express RequestHandler type signature
3. WHEN accessing Request properties THEN they SHALL include get, protocol, originalUrl, and other Express properties
4. WHEN using Response objects THEN they SHALL be compatible with Express Response type

### Requirement 3: Import Missing Enums and Types

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all required enums and types to be properly imported so that I can use them without compilation errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using AttendanceStatus enum THEN it SHALL be imported from the correct types module
2. WHEN using AttendanceMethod enum THEN it SHALL be imported from the correct types module
3. WHEN using other enums THEN they SHALL be available from their respective type definitions
4. WHEN importing types THEN they SHALL be imported from the correct path and module

### Requirement 4: Fix Request Object Type Extensions

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Request objects to have all necessary properties available so that middleware can access them without type errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing req.get() method THEN it SHALL be available on the Request type
2. WHEN accessing req.protocol property THEN it SHALL be available on the Request type
3. WHEN accessing req.originalUrl property THEN it SHALL be available on the Request type
4. WHEN extending Request with custom properties THEN they SHALL be properly typed in declaration files

### Requirement 5: Clean Up Unused Variables and Imports

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the codebase to be clean without unused variables so that the build process is efficient and the code is maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN variables are declared but not used THEN they SHALL be removed or marked as intentionally unused
2. WHEN destructuring assignments contain unused elements THEN they SHALL be removed or prefixed with underscore
3. WHEN imports are declared but not used THEN they SHALL be removed
4. WHEN function parameters are not used THEN they SHALL be prefixed with underscore to indicate intentional non-usage

### Requirement 6: Fix Service Method Signatures

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all service method calls to match their actual implementations so that the application functions correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calling generateDemoData method THEN it SHALL exist on the SetupWizardService class
2. WHEN calling service methods THEN they SHALL match the expected parameter types and count
3. WHEN implementing service interfaces THEN all required methods SHALL be implemented
4. WHEN method signatures change THEN all calling code SHALL be updated accordingly

### Requirement 7: Fix Router Middleware Type Compatibility

**User Story:** As a developer, I want router middleware to be properly typed so that Express.js routing works without compilation errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using router.use() with middleware THEN the middleware SHALL be compatible with Express middleware types
2. WHEN using router.get/post/put/delete with handlers THEN they SHALL match RequestHandler type signature
3. WHEN chaining middleware THEN all middleware SHALL have compatible type signatures
4. WHEN using authentication middleware THEN it SHALL be compatible with Express Router methods

### Requirement 8: Fix Missing Module Imports

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all required modules to be properly imported so that the application can access all necessary dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN importing from '../../shared' THEN the module SHALL exist or the import path SHALL be corrected
2. WHEN using external libraries THEN their type definitions SHALL be available
3. WHEN importing internal modules THEN the paths SHALL be correct and the modules SHALL exist
4. WHEN using Buffer.from() THEN the correct overload SHALL be used for the provided arguments
