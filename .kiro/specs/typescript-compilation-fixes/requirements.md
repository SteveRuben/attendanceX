# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The backend application currently has 180 TypeScript compilation errors across 28 files. These errors are preventing successful builds and indicate type safety issues that could lead to runtime errors. The errors fall into several categories:

1. Missing or incorrect type definitions
2. Interface mismatches between shared types and implementation
3. Unused imports and variables
4. Missing properties on types
5. Incorrect generic type usage
6. Inconsistent enum usage

This spec addresses the systematic resolution of these compilation errors to ensure type safety and successful builds.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Fix Type Definition Mismatches

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all TypeScript interfaces to match their actual usage so that the code compiles without errors and provides accurate type checking.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN shared types are imported THEN they SHALL match the actual data structures used in the application
2. WHEN interfaces are defined THEN they SHALL include all required properties used in the implementation
3. WHEN generic types are used THEN they SHALL provide the correct number of type arguments
4. WHEN enums are referenced THEN they SHALL use the correct enum values that exist in the shared package

### Requirement 2: Resolve Missing Property Errors

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all object properties to be properly typed so that I can access them without compilation errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing user properties THEN the User interface SHALL include all properties like role, status, permissions, organizationId
2. WHEN accessing event properties THEN the Event interface SHALL include all properties like organizationId, capacity, participants
3. WHEN accessing request objects THEN they SHALL include all properties used in the implementation
4. WHEN working with organization context THEN the user object SHALL include organization-related properties

### Requirement 3: Fix Generic Type Usage

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all generic types to be properly parameterized so that type checking works correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN extending BaseModel THEN it SHALL provide the required type parameter
2. WHEN using Firestore types THEN they SHALL match the expected generic signatures
3. WHEN defining model classes THEN they SHALL properly implement their base class contracts

### Requirement 4: Clean Up Unused Imports and Variables

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the codebase to be clean without unused imports so that the build process is efficient and the code is maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN imports are declared THEN they SHALL be used in the file or removed
2. WHEN variables are declared THEN they SHALL be used or removed
3. WHEN destructuring assignments are made THEN all destructured elements SHALL be used or marked as intentionally unused

### Requirement 5: Fix Enum and Constant Usage

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all enums and constants to be properly defined and used so that there are no reference errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using InvitationStatus THEN it SHALL use the correct enum from the appropriate module
2. WHEN using OrganizationRole THEN it SHALL be properly imported and typed
3. WHEN using NotificationType THEN it SHALL match the available enum values
4. WHEN using UserRole THEN it SHALL be consistently typed across all usage

### Requirement 6: Fix Method Signature Mismatches

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all method calls to match their signatures so that the application functions correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calling service methods THEN they SHALL exist on the service class
2. WHEN passing parameters THEN they SHALL match the expected types and count
3. WHEN returning values THEN they SHALL match the declared return types
4. WHEN implementing interfaces THEN all required methods SHALL be implemented

### Requirement 7: Fix Authentication and User Context Types

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the authentication and user context types to be consistent so that user data can be accessed reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing req.user THEN it SHALL include all necessary properties like organizationId
2. WHEN working with LoginResponse THEN it SHALL match the expected interface
3. WHEN handling user models THEN they SHALL provide access to all user properties
4. WHEN working with organization context THEN the types SHALL support organization-related operations

### Requirement 8: Ensure Backward Compatibility

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the type fixes to maintain backward compatibility so that existing functionality continues to work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN fixing types THEN existing API contracts SHALL remain unchanged
2. WHEN updating interfaces THEN optional properties SHALL be used where appropriate to maintain compatibility
3. WHEN modifying shared types THEN all consuming code SHALL continue to function
4. WHEN resolving errors THEN the fixes SHALL not break existing business logic
